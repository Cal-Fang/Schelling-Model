# Schelling-Model
This is a self-training project.

Thomas Schelling (1971) created an agent based model using checker boards to simulate the creation of segregated neighborhoods, in a society where no individual necessarily has a strong preference for segregation. To see a simulation with a visual component, visit the bottom of this page: http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/ The following code will replicate his model in Python.
